## Questions :

- Is there an Adobe Creative Cloud account I can use to get the Trajan Pro for the font. Otherwise... I found the font [here](https://github.com/htroche/CrowdTrivia/tree/master/RawGraphicAssets/Trajan%20Pro%20FONT). Please let me know if it is the right one, and if so I'll use this one.

> Will need a header, however we probably won’t need a menu bar. How does the logo/brand name work on this background?
- A header but no menu bar, does it mean a top bar with no link ? If so what purpose does this header have ? 
==I think it would be better (since it is a single page website) to have the header on the top of the document but not separate it in a different section==

>  Ronan - can you please see what RGB color is closest to the above

Purple: #5e0080
Orange: #FFA500


> On the following pages is the Brand Story | Intro about us. This will have a URL … octopusalliances.com/ X
- I don't understand. Do they want to use subdomains as a way to navigate on the same website ? It is very recommended to not do this, as sessions, cookies etc.. are not shared between subdomains, and this may cause a lot of issues.
- If it is different websites, please ignore my comment.

> Last page of the document, the blue buttons
- Can I have the links they are supposed to redirect to ?

For the colours:
I do **not** recommend Gold on Black or Orange on Purple, as it is very hard to read depending on the screen, brightness etc...
With the shades on the document, the purple is too dark to put anything other than white/very pale colours.

## Missing media
Could you ask them all the media present on the PDF separately ?
